    "1": "The invention of Braille was a major turning point in the history of disability. The writing system of raised dots used by visually impaired people was developed by Louis Braille in nineteenth-century France. In a society that did not value disabled people in general, blindness was particularly stigmatized, and lack of access to reading and writing was a significant barrier to social participation. The idea of tactile reading was not entirely new, but existing methods based on sighted systems were difficult to learn and use. As the first writing system designed for blind peopleâ€™s needs, Braille was a groundbreaking new accessibility tool. It not only provided practical benefits, but also helped change the cultural status of blindness. This essay begins by discussing the situation of blind people in nineteenth-century Europe. It then describes the invention of Braille and the gradual process of its acceptance within blind education.",

    "2": "A Teacher is someone who acts as a guide and inspiration to people both young and old. He/she is charged with the responsibility of creating awareness as well as opening the mind of people by instilling values, morals, and ethics. Teachers efforts are recognized during the teacher's day. They shape minds, and we annually celebrate their contribution to the development of society in the form of Teacher's day across the world. However, We celebrate The International Teachers Day on October 5th annually. Teachers are respected and honored for their important contribution in shaping individuals. 5th of September is annually celebrated as Teacher's day in India. This is actually the birthday of the former President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. The contributions and efforts made by teachers never go unnoticed. This led to the inauguration of the Teacher's day which seeks to celebrate the efforts made by the teachers.",

    "3": "In the 21st century, the rapid development of information technology and the rapid increase in information exchange have brought new drives and innovative ideas to the whole society. The wide adoption of information technology by the community has led to great changes. These changes are not simply in the context of data processing or computing. They are changes which affect how we communicate with each other, how we organise our daily activities, how we educate the younger generation, and how we run business. The great development and acceptance of information technology, computer network and Internet have transformed the mode of operation of many businesses, and at the same time have brought along unprecedented business opportunities. Businesses are now able to conduct transactions across geographical boundaries, across time zones and at a high efficiency. E-Commerce has become the market trend of the Century."
